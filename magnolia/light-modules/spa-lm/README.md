## Security

In this light module, `bypassWorkspaceAcls` configuration items are used to simplify the code. However, they should be removed in production and replaced by adding a user with permissions to execute REST endpoints as well as acess the required workspaces. For minimal projects, the website, the dam workspaces are used.

In the minimal projects, the fetch commands also need to be updated to add Basic Auth
```javascript
export async function fetchPageNav(nodeName, navBase, config) {
  const pageNavRes = await fetch(navBase + nodeName, config);
  return await pageNavRes.json();
}

const credentials = btoa("USER:PASSWORD");
const auth = { "Authorization" : `Basic ${credentials}` };
const headers = { headers : auth });

fetchPageNav(nodeName, environment.navBase, headers);
```
